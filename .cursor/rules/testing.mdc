# Testing Guidelines

## Stack
- **Unit/Integration**: Jest + Testing Library + jsdom
- **E2E**: Playwright
- **API Mocking**: MSW (Mock Service Worker)

## Organization
- Co-locate tests: `Component.test.tsx`
- Use `__tests__/` for complex suites
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## React Testing
- Testing Library user-centric queries
- Test interactions, not implementation
- Mock API calls with MSW handlers
- Test loading/success/error states

## Key Test Areas
- **Components**: User interactions, accessibility
- **API**: TanStack Query hooks, offline behavior
- **Auth**: Login/logout flows, protected routes
- **Upload**: File validation, drag-drop, progress
- **Player**: Play/pause/seek, playlist management
- **PWA**: Service worker, offline capabilities

## Best Practices
- Descriptive test names
- Use `data-testid` for complex queries
- Clean up after tests
- Maintain coverage for critical paths
